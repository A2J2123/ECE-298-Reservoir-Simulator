## üèóÔ∏è What is this project?

This project features a fully integrated reservoir simulation platform that:

- Measures real-time water level and displays the percentage full.
- Controls water flow direction and simulates water pumping.
- Monitors pump speed, indicates flow direction, and transmits live measurements to a computer via UART.
- Models practical water management and feedback control scenarios using embedded systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

The simulator is powered by an STM32 microcontroller, programmed in C, and incorporates:

- **Servo Motor:** Controls flow direction (simulates outlet switching).
- **DC Motor:** Drives the water pump, with speed monitored by an RPM sensor.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures water level with high accuracy.
- **RGB LED:** Provides visual status indicators.
- **Custom Timer PCB:** Drives a seven-segment display for real-time feedback.
- **UART Connection:** Streams sensor data and system state to a computer for monitoring and analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Architecture

- **Embedded C Code:** Collects and processes sensor data, manages actuator control, and implements feedback logic for accurate reservoir simulation.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Water level, flow direction, and pump speed are displayed and logged for live monitoring.
